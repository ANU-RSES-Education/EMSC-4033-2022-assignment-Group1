## Overview of the repository 

EMSC-4033-2022-assignment-Group1 is created by Sam, Gwendolyn and Xulu. This is the repository where we collaborated to produce relevant functions and modules to map a region of interest using 
Cartopy package in Python. More details about the functionality of this repository can be referred to README.md. 

## Pull requests and pull request reviews 

We worked individually to produce our own version of MapMaker.ipynb, RunTests.ipynb, test_functions.py and my_functions.py. We committed our changes in our own branch and pushed it to the main
as pull requests. 
Collaborative work was then communicated through pull requests where we reviewed each other's Jupyter Notebooks and Python modules. 
We commented on places for suggested improvements (e.g. fixing bugs, adding extra comments/docstrings for clarity etc.) to the owner of that version. 
The owner would evaluate the comments and made relevant changes. Then the pull requests were merged to the main branch to produce the final version. 

## Creating and resolving issues. 

'Issues' is our chat platform. 
We used it to discuss coding questions, confusion on the assessment, general updates on what each other were/should be working on. We assigned each issue to relevant collaborators 
so that they will be notified. 


## Collaborative editing of documents

We each again worked individually first to create our own version of documentaion including the README.md and the report.md file. We committed the changes we made as pull requests for others to 
review. After we combined everyone's opinions, we merged them together and pushed it to the main branch.    


## Adding tests

Since we each worked separately first, we all had different ways or considerations for testing. We reviewed each others' test module in pull requests. 
We discarded redundant test functions and merged them together as our final test module.
