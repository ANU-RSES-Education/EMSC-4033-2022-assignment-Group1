## Overview of the repository 

EMSC-4033-2022-assignment-Group1 is created by Sam, Gwendolyn and Xulu. This is the repository where we collaborated to produce relevant functions and modules to map a region of interest using Cartopy package in Python. More details about the functionality of this repository stored within the README.md. 


## Pull requests and pull request reviews 

We worked individually to produce our own version of MapMaker.ipynb, RunTests.ipynb, test_functions.py and my_functions.py. We committed our changes in our own branch and pushed it to the mainas pull requests. Individual work was accomplished in Jupyter Hub, as per course structure, and initial pushes originated from the Jupyter Hub terminal. Collaborative work was then communicated through pull requests where we reviewed each other's Jupyter Notebooks and Python modules. We commented on the pull requests and suggested improvements (e.g. fixing bugs, adding extra comments/docstrings for clarity etc.) both in line-by-line comments and overall feedback. The owner would evaluate the comments and made relevant changes. Then the pull requests were merged to the main branch to produce the final version. 


## Creating and resolving issues. 

'Issues' is our primary chat platform. 
We used it to discuss coding questions, confusion on the assessment, general updates on what each other were/should be working on. We assigned each issue to relevant collaborators so that they will be notified. For individual folders, comments were created both in-line within the documents and as general commentary in the pull request. Subsequent pull requests and edits were addressed in a combination of the GitHub platform and the Jupyter Hub. Once files (such as the README.md and report.md) were pushed to the GitHub directory, further edits and comments were accomplished in GitHub. Any final merges with the main directory required approval of at least one other team member, which ensured consistency and mitigated chance of error.


## Collaborative editing of documents

We each again worked individually first to create our own version of documentaion including the README.md and the report.md file. We committed the changes we made as pull requests or in issues' threads for others to, predominantly within the GitHub interface. After we combined everyone's opinions, we merged them together and pushed it to the main branch.    


## Adding tests

Since we each worked separately first, we all had different ways or considerations for testing. We reviewed each others' test module in pull requests. 
So in each of our folder, there are tests for slightly different aspects of the functions.
